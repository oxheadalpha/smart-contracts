(*
  Reference implementation if `multi_token` core API.

  Since Babylon does not support pairs as keys for big_map,
  This implementation uses composite `balance_key` represented as `nat`.
  Assumed number of different token types is 2^32 (`max_tokens` constant).
  Both token ID and owner ID are "packed" into single `nat` using first 32 bits
  for token ID and the rest of the bits for owner ID.
  Contract storage also keeps mapping between owner address and owner ID
  represented as `nat` (see `owner_lookup`).

  If tokens are transferred to a new owner address which does not exist
  in `owner_loop` yet, new entry withing lookup is created and the owner
  is assigned a new `nat` ID. This implementation may change in future,
  if support for white list is needed.

  Current implementation is optimized for token transfer, but makes it
  difficult for adding functionality in future which might need retrieve
  aggregate data (like list all token types held by the owner).
